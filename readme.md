# Keylogger Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures keystrokes and logs them to a text file. This tool is meant for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes including special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Function keys).
- Logs keystrokes to a file (`log.txt`).
- Converts the Python script into an executable file.
- Optionally configures the executable to run on system startup.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
